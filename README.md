# bare-sftp (Pruned Fork Edition)

The `bare-sftp` (bsftp) package removes all operations not supported by Barebones from the parent project. This branch is a pruned version of the fantastic `sftp` package, with added functionality enabling for the restriction of the spawned SSH session's root directory. It was the original SFTP implemention used by Barebones, preceding the current clean-slate implementation existing on the master branch.

The README and repository for the parent project can be found at [sftp](https://github.com/pkg/sftp#sftp).
