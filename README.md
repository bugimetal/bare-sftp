# bare-sftp

The `bare-sftp` package removes all operations not supported by Barebones. It is a pruned version of the fantastic `sftp` package, with added functionality enabling for the restriction of the spawned SSH session's root directory.

The README and repository for the parent project can be found at [sftp](https://github.com/pkg/sftp#sftp).
